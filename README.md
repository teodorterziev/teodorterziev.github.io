# [NoirBlade blog](https://teodorterziev.github.io)

What to expect here?
===

In this blog I will post some useful tutorials or “howtos” on topics related to software development, DevOps and system administration.

I will start with some basic thinks about BigData processing and will see how it goes. I will use this blog as a reference for myself about setting and executing things on BigData or whatever it comes.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
